# Async comprehensions

Async comprehensions were introduced in Python 3.6 as a way to create asynchronous generators using the async for syntax.

Async comprehensions allow you to easily iterate over asynchronous sequences of data, such as asyncio.Queue objects or other asynchronous generators.

To use an async comprehension, you can use the async for syntax to iterate over an asynchronous iterable, and yield each element in turn.

Async comprehensions are similar to list comprehensions and generator expressions, but they are designed specifically for use with asynchronous code.

Async comprehensions can be used to write concise and readable code that performs asynchronous operations in parallel, making it easy to write high-performance asynchronous code.

When using async comprehensions, it's important to remember that each iteration of the loop may take some amount of time to complete, so it's important to use appropriate concurrency primitives, such as asyncio.gather(), to ensure that your code runs efficiently and doesn't block the event loop.
